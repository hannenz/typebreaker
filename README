#TypeBreaker

A typing monitor and typing break application inspired by drwright.
After i could not get drwright running on elementaryos I decided
to port it and learn vala/ elementary development by this means.

The result is a bit of a clone/ rewrite/ hack which gets its job
done and helped me diving into vala programming.
